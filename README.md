# Pathfinding Visualizer

An interactive pathfinding visualizer built with **React** and **Tailwind CSS**.  
This tool allows users to understand how pathfinding algorithms operate by visualizing their behavior step by step in a dynamic grid.

## Features

- Click and drag to draw walls (obstacles)
- Supports multiple pathfinding algorithms:
  - Breadth-First Search (BFS)
  - Depth-First Search (DFS)
  - Dijkstra’s Algorithm
  - A* (A-Star) Algorithm
- Visual distinctions between:
  - Start and end nodes
  - Visited nodes and the shortest path
- Clear the current path or reset the entire grid
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Fully responsive layout with a modern dark theme

## Technologies Used

- React (with Create React App)
- Tailwind CSS
- JavaScript (ES6+)
